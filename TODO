Bugs
----

[ * 2PEE (domain 2PEE-3 by DDOMAIN decomposition): (another serpin) why is 
    small sheet to the left  of instead of above the large sheet (as it is for 
    1QLP etc. - these should be drawn the same way). ] DONE 10/2/08

[ * helix clustering works well generally but some problems e.g. why are 
  7API and 1MTP helix clusters different, they should be the same.
  (more serpins to compare: 1QLP, 1SNG). ] DONE 9/2/08 - 
                                           BUT SEE FIXME/TODO IN PTRELPOS.PY

[ * Stop helix clusters from being placed between sheets (when -j selected) ]
  DONE 27/2/08.

[ * coredumps in TableauCreator ] NOW USING INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION 4/2/08

[ * sheet helix/cluster overlap eg 1JN9-1, 1K2X-2, 2ONJ-3, 1YTE ] 
  NO LONGER HAPPENS ON LATEST VERSION (R1083, 16/2/08 OR EVEN R1068, 11/2/08)
  FIXED BY HELIX CLUSTERING CHANGES.

[ * problem with barrel breaking (arbitrary) eg 1JDU sometimes can cause
  assertion failures (CATH domain C1). Need to implement proper cycle
  detection (see flower94, flower95, paton69) ] DONE 22/2/08 using back
                                                edges from DFS for cycle
                                                detection - still somewhat
                                                arbitrary but better. See
                                                notes 22/2/08 for details on
                                                1JDU-C1 Rossman fold.

[ * (Related to previous point) With the new cycle detection/breaking method,
    1BBP-1 is wrong, was better before. Still need more work on deciding
    which edge to break. (see notes 22/2/08). Also 1UPS-2. ] DONE 27/2/08
                                                             See notes 27/2/08
                                                             and above, but
                                                             still could do
                                                             with better rules
                                                             here probably
                                                             (see 22/2/08 notes)

* Shape overlaps and general mess with 3_10 and pi helices included.

* Some are still a complete mess with sheet overlaps etc. e.g 2HMG

[ * handle insertion codes properly (see eg 1HVC which fails). Also
    e.g. 2D26 (when using STRIDE, but not DSSP), and 1EAI (if using -35),
    also e.g. 1ABI (crashes with STRIDE, diagram goes wrong with DSSP). 
] DONE 21-22/6/08 

[ * have use_longest_for_orientation to choose to use longest rather
    than nearest strand in sheet for orientation. Currently using nearest
    (using longest makes 2PEE-3 different from other serpins (1QLP, 1MTP, etc.)
    for example, due to very bent longest strand in large sheet).
] OUT OF DATE, CHANGED (prior to 2/3/08), but next point still valid:
  Maybe should use strand with best fitting axis for orientation instead?

* still some cases where strand position is wrong e.g. 2ANT-2 [is this
  still the case] but definitely 2BUK (strand 7 should be in line with strand
  6 not strand 3; see notes 21/2/08).

* overlaps between helix clusters and aligned (non-cluster) helices, 
  not always resolved by Dunnart
  (e.g. 1HJR, 2GN0-3, 2GN1, 2GN2). Also 2QP2 (when multidomain, resolved
  if only 2QP2-1)

* Will not work when a domain contains multiple segments of a chain
  with in-between segments in other domains. (Will then need multiple
  pseudo- N- and C- terminus nodes in a single chain in the domain(s)).
  Does not currently happen with DDOMAIN, CATH but could happen in general
  with other domain decomposition methods. (Also inelegance/inefficiency
  in finding the interdomain connections)

* For helix labeling A,B,etc. need to got to AA,AB,etc. when more than 26.

* color gradient restarts for each chain for single domains, but when
  multidomain is used, gradient continues along whole protein (across
  chains and domains). Should make this consistent one way or the other.

* make restarting of labels (and color gradient) at each domain in multidomain
  cartoons an option, instead of always numbering and coloring across domains
  with no restart.

* now that multidomain cartoons are available, need to change helix cluster
  coloring so that there are different colors in different domains
  (since nearby clusters in one domain are red, and so are those in another
   but the two domains are not near each other).

[ * fix residue/seqnum hovertext on interdomain connectors - currently connectors
   to/from pseudo-termini have residues but interdomain connectors (when used
   instead of pseudo-termini) do not have any residue information.
] DONE 23/6/08.

* assertion failure (obj2.isalpha()) in calc_sheet_dist_matrix() on 1K73.pdb.
  Also 1VQ8 (nb also very slow on this one - very large structure, no 
  domain decompositino from DDOMAIN) (using test rev1549:1551)

* tricky problem with helix cluster proximity clustering, can get two
  clusters with default color that are not actually prxomimate due to
  creation of single-helix cluster e.g. in 1SEO 
  (../ptgraph2.py -v  -r -35 -k fuchsia -e auto -uw ~/pdb/1SEO.pdb)
  single-helix cluster Da (close to Aa,Ba,Ca) should cause default color
  cluster Ea,Fa,Ga also to be red (close to Da) (maybe? - may not also 
  be close to Aa,Ba,Ca?) but instead Ea,Fa,Ga and Kb,Jb,Ib,Hb are
  same color (deafult color (fuchsia)) even though they are not prxomiate.


[ * crash on 1PJS (attribute error line 2108 ptgraph2.py)
  with no domain decomposition, using distance matrix not
  heuristics. (only charikar:1080 (rev 1549:1551),
  not charikar:2080 (rev 1457) where it works, and
  gives a very big and hugely messy diagram). (26/08/08) ] FIXED 22/10/08


[ * (found 20June09) foe separate labelling (helix labelling A,B,C,etc.)
  find that when using PDB HELIX and SHEET cards to define SSEs, labelling
  is in wrong order (ie.g. on 1HH1 (no pi/310) get helices labelld C,B,A
  from N to C not A,B,C. ] FIXED 12/09/09.

 * if strands/helices are coloured black, make the text label colour for
   those ones white (currently get black on black so unreadable).

 * AssertionError: /local/munk/proorigami-test/ptgraph/ptgraph2.py", line 6084, in build_in terdomain_connectors 
   when using CATH domain decomposition e.g. on 16GS
   also (related?) ERROR: SSE in more than 2 domains e.g. on 1A1V
   (using CATH domain decomp, and options -uw)

 * File "/local/munk/proorigami-test/ptgraph/ptgraph2.py", line 6085, in build_interdomain_connectors
  assert(seqnum_diff >= -2) # NB can be -2 as +-1 'fake' resnum
  AssertionError 
  when using DDomain on e.g. 2A1S and options -uw

 * 3MGB seems to cause ptgraph2.py to loop (12 hours+ then killed) when run
   with -r35 -t dssp -k purple -l crossing:black,red,green,navy,blue -b sequential -j -e auto -f auto -o gradient -p cath:/local/munk/proorigami-test/cath/CathDomall.v3.3.0
   problem related to WARNING: residue 391 (chain D) not found. May be HETATM.


Changes
-------

. [  Instead of rainbow (index) coloring, color by chain:
    - color the lines a different color for each chain (dark colors only: 
      black, blue, magenta, purple etc.) ] DONE 28/1/08

. [  color helix clusters one color, sheets another. I.e. color the actual 
     helices and strands this color (simplified coloring scheme). ] DONE 28/1/08

. [ color (shade) different cluster of helices that are actually close by in 
    3d space the same color. e.g. E helix and B,C,D helix cluster in 
    native state serpin 1SNG. ] DONE 13/2/08 although there are problems to be
                                resolved, see comments in code and notes 
                                12-16/2/08. Also need to decide whether
                                this should be shading (cluster background)
                                or shape fill coloring.

. [ Eliminate chain id in numbering, just number all SSEs sequentially 
    (not restarting for each chain). ] DONE 28/1/08

. [ 2QP2: when using no domain decomposition, C terminal domain gets mixed 
    up in the other domain. For this option (no domains) should, rather than 
    operating on the whole protein, still do the domain decomposition and 
    operate on the domains separately, and then put all domains on the same 
    diagram. ] DONE 25/2/08-28/2/08

. think about some other way to indicate unrolled barrels (asterisk on 
label is not very obvious).

. try relative placement of helices in cluster by projection onto plane
  normal to mutual perpendicular to axes rather than current method relying
  on dihedral angle with nearby sheet strands as reference.
  (See notebook 1/2/08 - 8/2/08 on tableau angles, axis fitting etc.)

. Check for axis coplanarity in tableau computation.

. Allow use of different NMR models, and compare results to make sure
  different models give same/similar cartoon.

. Implement sandwich detection by strand centroid distance
   as per notes 26-27/02/08 and compare with
  'unfolding hinge' heuristic implemented 02/03/08.

. related to above, maybe should enforce above/below rather than left/right
  relative placement of sandwich-like folds when detected (e.g. 4RHV which
  is currently placed left/right)

. Handle COMPND record CHAIN entries to detect duplicated/symmetric chains
  i.e. chain ids on the CHAIN entry are duplicates, only use the first one?
  (Kian's pdb.py handles this).

* Draw a dotted line box around domains on multidomain cartoons.

[ * Adjust line width. Difficult to do in Dunnart editor currently, but easy
    enough on webserver by adjusting SVG attributes. ] DONE 22/4/08.

[ * option to disable labels on SSEs. ] DONE 21/4/08.

[ * Option to color each sheet (the actual strands, not the cluster background
    shading) a different color. ] DONE 23/4/08.

[ * Send command to browser to fit SVG in window (see
    adaptagrams.sourceforge net). ] DONE 18/4/08.

[ * Try to detect non-SVG capable browsers (like current versions of Internet
   Explorer?) and notify user that SVG not available and advanced
   features (such as immediately following) are not available.
] DONE 27/6/08.

[ * Drop-down menu to select colors. Provide list of colors to select from,
  or (more advanced) have "interactive" SVG by embedding JavaScript
  to allow setting of colors there. ] DONE (simple only) 25/4/08.

[ * add PDF output option. ] DONE 21/4/08.

[ * move shading options to SSE color options group. ] DONE 21/4/08.

[ * separate clustering options and add a new "labelling" title for SSE label
  options. ] DONE 21/4/08.

[  * indication (different color/shape) for pi and 3_10 helices. ] DONE 17/6/08

  * rearrange code so properly separted into directories, library type
    modules (ptnode.py, getdomains.py, etc.) in a subdirectory so
    can be imported from there and users of them in separate directories
    (ptgraph2 (pro-origami), pytableaucreate, pttabmatchpbool, etc.)
    since these are really all different programs and should not just
    all sit in ptgraph2 directory (they were just there as it was easy
    at the time for them all to share modules that way).

  * replace Bio.PDB parsing (and probably my DSSP and STRIDE parsing) with
    Kian's smaller and simpler (and probably less buggy) PDB.py module
    (which will sort out the insertion code problems, and optionally
    remove crystal symmetry chains for example).

  * add more colors to the color lookup table, not just the 16 HTML colors
    (e.g. use /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt)

  * (since fixing insertino code) noticed that sometimes STRIDE reports
    H bonds to residues that don't exist, seems that possibly just the
    chain identifier is wrong (bonds between chains)? E.g. 1EAI, 1ABI.

  * Make sure Jmol secondary structure assignment matches Pro-origami
  
  * Make Jmol color scheme match Pro-origami, including color matching
    for gradient, and same colors for all other color schemes.

[  * User-selected colors must have options to add more colors for extra
    items (not just the hardcoded set of 5 each so far) and also RGB 
    user-settable options. Need to use JavaScript to make dynamic content
    for this.
] DONE 27/6/08 (RGB done 28/6/08)

   * new JavaScript stuff does not work on IE6. (too hard to bother - wasted
     2 days trying to get it work work)?

   * direction indicator (arrow, or use convex/concave ends as in/out side?)
     on helices.



Enhancements
------------
Apart from bug fixes for assertion failures, TableauCreator problems, Dunnart
fixes (connector nudging etc.)

0. Comparison with as many hand-drawn ones as possible to identify what needs
   to be changed.     
1.[  Helix clustering (James). ] DONE
2. interactive 'unfolding' of picture from 3d to 2d (Kim, Tim, Michael)
3. Alternative uses of color gradient (other than sequence position):
   a. B-factor (from PDB) (Ash)
   b. deviation of sheet from planarity (Noel etc. at cancer genomics group)
4. Show turns/coil somehow (Noel, etc. at cancer genomics group).
   Somehow automatically identifying 'important' loop regions (eg RCL
   on intact serpins) would be interesting. (see notes 19/2/08).
5. Automatically draw a line to show significant sheet bending, using the axis
   fitting. Like the 'bend point in sheet' line in the top secret diagram. (me)
5a. Also a 'fold line' between sheets that have been 'unfolded' by beta
    sandwich-like heurstic. (James).
[ 6. Hover text showing residues. ]  DONE 1/5/2008 (basic version)
7. Use SVG color gradient on shapes 
   (see ptgraph/demo/svgexamples/cologradient.svg)
8. (Arun) represent beta bulges.
9. (Arun 26/08/08) needs to work better on all-alpha domains. 
   Treat all contacts between SSEs like those between strands in sheets
   i.e. SSEs in contacts grouped together.
10 (James 18/9/08) 'fold' color scheme (see notes/emails/foldcolor.jw.email.txt)
   As of 19/9/08 implemented simple version for strands in sheet only but
   need to:
       . also do it for helix clusters
       [ select maximally contrasting colors (see refs in code comments) ] DONE 1/10/2008
       . decide whetehr any coil region is good enough (currently done)
         or if only actual 'turns' or 'short' coil regions should be used to
         consider as connected
       . fix bug with pi and 3_10 helices: when they are not included, still get
         different colors on strands separated by them (as they are still
         in internal data structures, just not shown on cartoon - need
         to ignore them when they are not selected to be shown).
